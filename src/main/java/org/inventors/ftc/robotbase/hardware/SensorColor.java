/**
 * This is an example LinearOpMode that shows how to use a color sensor in a generic
 * way, regardless of which particular make or model of color sensor is used. The Op Mode
 * assumes that the color sensor is configured with a name of "sensor_color".
 *
 * There will be some variation in the values measured depending on the specific sensor you are using.
 *
 * You can increase the gain (a multiplier to make the sensor report higher values) by holding down
 * the A button on the gamepad, and decrease the gain by holding down the B button on the gamepad.
 *
 * If the color sensor has a light which is controllable from software, you can use the X button on
 * the gamepad to toggle the light on and off. The REV sensors don't support this, but instead have
 * a physical switch on them to turn the light on and off, beginning with REV Color Sensor V2.
 *
 * If the color sensor also supports short-range distance measurements (usually via an infrared
 * proximity sensor), the reported distance will be written to telemetry. As of September 2020,
 * the only color sensors that support this are the ones from REV Robotics. These infrared proximity
 * sensor measurements are only useful at very small distances, and are sensitive to ambient light
 * and surface reflectivity. You should use a different sensor if you need precise distance measurements.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this Op Mode to the Driver Station OpMode list
